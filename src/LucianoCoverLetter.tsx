        <p className="mb-2">
          I am very exited to apply for the Staff Software Engineer position at
          mParticle. I was refereed to this opportunity by Gabriel Tirbúrcio,
          who is a Team Lead. They shared their positive experience working at

          Over the past 6 years, I had developed solid skills in developing and
          maintaining mobile and web applications, primarily with the React
          framework, which I have been working with for over 5 years. I started
          as a fullstack developer, but I have recently been focusing on my
          frontend skills recently. My experience includes working on a variety
          of projects such as e-commerce applications, ERP systems, personal
          resources managing applications, services integrations, GraphQL and
          RESTful APIs and SQL database management, using agile development
          methodologies such as Kanban and Scrum depending on the team`s
          workflow. Additionally, I have experience in direct client
          interaction, managing and interpreting tasks assigned to me and
          actively collaborating with the teams to deliver high-quality
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">

          to further develop my skills and advance professionally, enabling me
